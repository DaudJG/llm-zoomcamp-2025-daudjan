# LLM Zoomcamp 2025 | Daud Jan

This repository contains my applied work from the LLM Zoomcamp.  
Each module is developed as a standalone mini-project with clean code, documentation, and results.  

## Contents

01-intro-rag/        Minimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline  
02-vector-search/    Vector database integration with Qdrant and FAISS  
03-evaluation/       Evaluation workflows and LLM-as-a-judge experiments  
04-monitoring/       Logging, dashboards, and feedback loops  
05-best-practices/   Hybrid search, reranking, and robustness techniques  
06-end-to-end-project/   Full application bringing all components together  
assets/              Diagrams, screenshots, and plots  

## Purpose

The aim of this repo is to demonstrate practical skills in building LLM systems:  
- retrieval and vector search  
- evaluation and monitoring  
- production-ready best practices
